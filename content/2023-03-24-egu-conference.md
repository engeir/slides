Notes:

Hi, and thanks for showing up to my talk here today. My name is Eirik Enger, and I'm a
PhD candidate at UiT the Arctic University of Norway. My work there focus on how
volcanoes affect climate, and today we will look at "Insensitivity of global temperature
response to the magnitude of volcanic eruptions".

## Motivation

See to the abstract, pull out some of it to mention here.

<!-- .slide: data-visibility="hidden" -->

Notes:

The reason we are visiting this topic is that there have been several attempts to do
[this], many of which focus on or assume [something about linearity maybe].

![Gregory AOD vs forcing](./attachments/gregory-aod-toa-swap-trans.png)

So, $M\_\{k,\\,\mathrm\{AOD\}\}^\max\propto M\_\{k,\\,\mathrm\{TOA\}\}^\max$?

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

This plot if from Gregory et al. (2016), and it's showing radiative forcing against
aerosol optical depth. Two simulations were done with the HadCM3 climate model by the
authors, one with the HadGEM2 climate model by [Andrews
(2014)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-13-00336.1) while the AR5 data points are from
a time series from the Fifth Assessment report of the IPCC (intergovernmental panel on
climate change).

This show a proportionality between annual mean values of AOD and radiative forcing, but
only for AOD values up to 0.15, roughly equivalent to the peak of the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo
eruption. Whether this property holds as one goes to much greater values, for example
comparable to the Young Toba Tuff eruption 74ky ago, is of interest to us. Such a super
volcano would have roughly one hundred times the AOD values as Mt. Pinatubo, but
previous simulations indicate radiative forcing values that are only about twenty times
Mt. Pinatubo. Is this because the relation does not hold for this large values or is it
a shortcoming on the model's side?

From Gregory et al. (2016):

> It would be useful for investigation of volcanic forcing and feedback in CMIP6 if
> ensemble experiments were conducted with historical volcanic aerosol as the only
> forcing agent in each AOGCM, to diagnose the climate response, and with the
> corresponding AGCMs with prescribed sea surface conditions, to diagnose the radiative
> forcing. This would reveal whether other models also exhibit a cloud adjustment and a
> lower climate sensitivity for volcanic forcing, and offer the opportunity for analysis
> of the processes involved.

Expect $M\_\{k,\\,\mathrm\{AOD\}\}^\max\propto
M\_\{k,\\,\mathrm\{TOA\}\}^\max,\\,\mathrm{AOD}\in (0,0.15)$

<!-- .element: style="font-size:13pt" -->

Notes:

One note to make about the AOD and radiative imbalance is that they are often assumed as
being proportional, with a proportionality constant of 25 estimated in the AR5.

Using a linear operator to describe temperature fluctuations:

$\Delta T(t)=\hat{L}[f(t)]$

Notes:

Previous efforts have often been to use a linear operator to describe temperature
fluctuations in response to a forcing. Some studies also assume the forcing from
different agents to be similar, although this have been disputed by several.

The equation is depicting the linear relation between some forcing F and the
deterministic temperature due to the forcing.

Here, we wish to look further into the linearity assumption in relation to volcanoes
over a large range of eruption magnitudes, where with magnitude it is meant the total
sulphur aerosol mass.

`$$
\Delta T=\phi\ast f_K=\phi\ast\sum_k A_k\delta(t-t_k)
$$`

`$$
A_k\left\{
\begin{aligned}
&\overset{?}{=}g(M_k^{\max})\\
&\overset{?}{=}M_k^{\max}
\end{aligned}
\right.,\,
M_k^\max=\left\{
\begin{aligned}
&\mathrm{SO_2\,[Tg]}\\
&\mathrm{AOD\,[1]}\\
&\mathrm{TOA\,[W/m^2]}
\end{aligned}
\right.
$$`

where `$M_k^{\max}$` is the magnitude of event `$k$`, given in `$\mathrm{Tg}$`
`$\mathrm{SO_2}$`, the `$\mathrm{AOD}$` (aerosol optical depth), top-of-the-atmosphere
radiative imbalance in `$\mathrm{W/m^2}$`, or possibly something else entirely.

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

We wish to ask: is it reasonable to write up the temperature response to volcanic
eruptions as a convolution between the forcing and some general shape function, here
represented by the letter ùúô.

The forcing is here consisting only of forcing due to episodic volcanoes, and we
consider three different sources to describe the forcing; total injected SO2 in
Tg, the aerosol optical depth and forcing as top-of-the-atmosphere radiative imbalance.
Injected SO2 is the input to the model that it reads from to simulate the volcanoes,
while both AOD and radiative imbalance are output variables of the model.

<!-- .element style="font-size:15pt" -->

Notes:

We have run the CESM2 as an AOGCM and AGCM with constant SST conditions with made up
volcanic eruptions of three different sizes: the smallest volcano is comparable to the
Mt. Pinatubo eruption, the largest volcano is comparable to the Young Toba Tuff eruption
(i.e., roughly 100 times Mt. Pinatubo), while the third sits in the middle between the
two extremes.

Notes:

Results from running CESM2(WACCM6) with a 400 Tg volcanic event occurring once (Single
event, orange) and occurring twice four years apart (Double event, blue). "Superposed"
in green is two copies of the single event superposed.

The volcano erupted on 15. February 1853 and on the same day in 1857, located at the
equator (1 degree east).
